# Competitive Programming Quality Criteria

Our code must follow this guideline: **"Correct - Fast - Easy to code - Easy to debug - Extensible - Elegant"**

## 1. Correctness ⚠️

- Must handle all test cases correctly
- Zero runtime/overflow errors
- Note: Fast but incorrect solutions are worthless

## 2. Speed ⚡

- Algorithm complexity must match constraints:
  - O(N log N) or better when N ≤ 10^5
  - O(N^2) acceptable when N ≤ 10^3
- Avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)

## 3. Implementation Speed 🔧

- Write quickly with minimal bugs
- Efficient time management
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones

## 4. Reusability 🔄

- Code should work for similar problems
- Use clear structure and functions
- Good for learning (optional in contests)

## 5. Easy Debugging 🔍

- Clear variable names
- Strategic debug statements
- Document magic numbers
- Essential for edge cases

## 6. Code Elegance ✨

- Concise, problem-specific solutions
- Improves coding skills
- Makes solutions impressive
